Why didn't we just use `read_html` in the first place? It's true the `read_html` works well when scraping information from an HTML *table*. Unfortunately, you often want to scrape information from a webpage that isn't conveniently stored in an HTML table, in which case `read_html` won't work. (It only searches for `<table>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` tags, but there are many other HTML tags.) Though Beautiful Soup is not as simple as `read_html`, it is more flexible and thus more widely applicable."
